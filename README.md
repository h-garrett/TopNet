# TopNet
TopNet! is a 2D arcade game made in Unity. I'm mainly using this repository to keep track of and showcase the C# scripts I've written for the game.

I've also included a folder titled "TopNet! Demo Videos" which contains a collection of videos of gameplay footage, meant to help 
document the development process of the game.
